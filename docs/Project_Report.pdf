📄 Quarky GO – Summer Internship Project Report
By: Het Shah
Internship: Embedded Systems Intern @ STEMpedia
Duration: Summer 2025

🔍 1. Project Overview
This project, Quarky GO v0.0.1, is a MicroPython firmware developed for the ESP32-WROOM-32E based board. It features a joystick-driven interactive menu, OLED-based UI, embedded games, and real-time motor/servo control. Built completely during the summer internship, it showcases deep integration between embedded programming and user interaction on resource-constrained devices.

🎯 2. Objective
To create a full-fledged interactive firmware system for Quarky hardware with:

A navigable OLED menu using joystick

Servo and motor control using PWM

Two built-in arcade-style games

Power-saving sleep mode using deep sleep

Modular and reusable code architecture

📈 6. Outcomes
Built a complete interactive embedded application using MicroPython.

Learned and implemented advanced topics like PWM control, deep sleep, and real-time UI rendering.

Practiced modular development and project structuring for open-source contribution.

Gained hands-on experience with joystick-controlled navigation and gaming logic.

🌱 7. Future Enhancements
Add sound via piezo buzzer for game events.

Integrate Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for connectivity.

Flash-based game high score memory.

More mini-games and control modules.

Optimize RAM and display usage for bigger screens.
